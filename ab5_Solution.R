#####Q2####

#A) Are these two groups of sampling paired or independent?
#   It is clear that the two groups are paired, 
#   because there is a bond between the readings, 
#   consisting in the fact that we are considering the same lake 
#   albeit in two different days.

# [1] V = 80, p-value = 0.873

#Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, 
#we conclude that the means have remained essentially unchanged 
#(we accept the null hypothesis H0), 
#then banning the boat rental for a single day did not lead to any improvements 
#in terms of pollution of the lake.

#The value V = 80 corresponds to the sum of ranks assigned to the differences with positive sign.
#We can calculate the sum of ranks assigned to the differences with positive sign,
#and the sum of ranks assigned to the differences with negative sign,
#to compare this interval with the interval tabulated on the tables of Wilcoxon for paired samples,
#and confirm our statistic decision. Hereâ€™s how to calculate the two sums.
